      "Okay, so I need to figure out the price of the Tiago iCNG based on the news article provided. Let me read through the excerpt carefully to extract all relevant information.\n",

      "The article starts by mentioning two models from Tata Motors: the Tiago iCNG and the Tigor iCNG. The pricing for these vehicles is discussed right after, so I should look for those numbers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the first part of the excerpt:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Tiago iCNG is priced between Rs 6.55 lakh and Rs 8.1 lakh, while the Tigor iCNG comes at a price range of Rs 7.8 lakh to Rs 8.95 lakh.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So it looks like the Tiago iCNG starts at Rs 6.55 lakh and goes up to Rs 8.1 lakh. The user is specifically asking for the price of the Tiago iCNG, so I need to provide both the minimum and maximum price range.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should double-check if there's any other mention of the Tiago iCNG in the article that could affect this pricing. Scanning further down, I see more details about the Punch iCNG but no additional information on the Tiago iCNG beyond its price range mentioned earlier.\n",

      "Therefore, based on the excerpt provided, the Tiago iCNG is priced between Rs 6.55 lakh and Rs 8.1 lakh.\n",
